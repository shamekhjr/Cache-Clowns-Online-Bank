	1) GenerateAuthKey() creates OTP in the OTP authenticator class and QR code in the QR authenticator class.

	2) Notify() in creditCardTransaction class stores a copy of the transaction log to save in the transaction history then notifies the client of the performed transaction.

	3) Update() method refreshes and updates all fields related to the client and sends a notification to the client if any updates occur to any of the relevant fields.
